    <h1>How Grateful I Am</h1>
    <p>If the one thing im thankfull for this year, its you! the way you shown up when it wasnt easy, the way stayed when others wouldn't, you told me to to see past parts of myself that i didnt like , you showed me how to love who iam, you didnt have to fix anything you just made it easier to breath to keep moving forward even when i wasn't sure how, Thanks you for making such impact on my life, for bringing me present that reminds me that things don't have to be perfect no matter, for trusting and believing me when i wasn't, for showing me just being there is enough, and just listings and being willing to be understand is more than most people offer, I don't know if you realise you have changed me in so many ways you made this year something worth remembering so thank you from the bottom of my heart Ill always be grateful for you</p>
